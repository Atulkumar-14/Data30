## 🧬 **Inheritance** 🧬

**What is it?**  
Inheritance lets a class (**child** 👶) inherit properties and methods from another class (**parent** 👨‍👩‍👧). It’s like passing down family traits, making code reusable and organized! 🔄

### 🔹 **Types of Inheritance** 🔹

- **Single Inheritance** ➡️: One child class inherits from one parent class.
- **Multiple Inheritance** ➕: One child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
- **Multilevel Inheritance** 📊: A chain of inheritance (e.g., grandparent → parent → child).

### 📜 **Example Code** 📜

```python
# 🧬 Single Inheritance: Child inherits from one Parent
class Animal:  # Parent class 🐾
    def speak(self):
        return "I make a sound! 🗣️"

class Dog(Animal):  # Child class inherits Animal 🐶
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof! 🐕"

# 🧬 Multilevel Inheritance: Grandparent → Parent → Child
class Mammal(Animal):  # Inherits Animal 🐾
    def walk(self):
        return "I walk on land! 🚶"

class Puppy(Dog, Mammal):  # Inherits Dog and Mammal 🐶
    def play(self):
        return "I love to play! 🎾"

# 🧬 Multiple Inheritance: Child inherits from multiple parents
class Swimmer:  # Another parent class 🏊‍♂️
    def swim(self):
        return "I swim in water! 🌊"

class Dolphin(Dog, Swimmer):  # Inherits Dog and Swimmer 🐬
    def jump(self):
        return "I jump out of water! 🐬"

# 🧪 Testing the classes
dog = Dog()
puppy = Puppy()
dolphin = Dolphin()

print(dog.speak())  # Output: I make a sound! 🗣️
print(puppy.speak())  # Output: I make a sound! 🗣️
print(puppy.walk())  # Output: I walk on land! 🚶
print(dolphin.swim())  # Output: I swim in water! 🌊
```

**Linear Explanation**:  
Inheritance is like a family tree where a child class gets all the features (methods and attributes) of its parent class(es). Single inheritance is straightforward (one parent). Multilevel builds a hierarchy (grandparent to child). Multiple inheritance combines features from multiple parents, but you need to manage conflicts if parents have similar methods.

## 🔄 **Method Overriding** 🔄

**What is it?**  
Method overriding lets a child class redefine a method from its parent class to give it a new behavior. Use `super()` to call the parent’s version if needed. 🔧

### 📜 **Example Code** 📜

```python
# 🔄 Parent class with a method
class Vehicle:  # Parent class 🚗
    def start_engine(self):
        return "Engine started! 🚀"

# 🔄 Child class overriding the parent method
class Car(Vehicle):  # Child class 🚙
    def start_engine(self):  # Override parent’s method
        parent_result = super().start_engine()  # Call parent’s method using super() 🔗
        return f"{parent_result} Car is ready to drive! 🛣️"

# 🧪 Testing the override
car = Car()
print(car.start_engine())  # Output: Engine started! 🚀 Car is ready to drive! 🛣️
```

**Linear Explanation**:  
Method overriding is like customizing a family recipe. The child class takes the parent’s method (e.g., `start_engine`) and gives it a new twist (e.g., adding “Car is ready to drive!”). Using `super()`, the child can still use the parent’s original method while adding its own flavor.

## 🦆 **Polymorphism** 🦆

**What is it?**  
Polymorphism means “many forms” 🌈—the same method can behave differently depending on the object calling it. In Python, this happens via **duck typing** (if it walks like a duck, it’s a duck 🦆) or **operator overloading** (e.g., redefining `+`).

### 🔹 **Duck Typing Example** 🔹

```python
# 🦆 Duck Typing: Same method name, different behavior
class Bird:  # Bird class 🐦
    def fly(self):
        return "I soar in the sky! ☁️"

class Airplane:  # Airplane class ✈️
    def fly(self):
        return "I fly with engines! 🛫"

# 🦆 Function that works with any object having a fly method
def let_it_fly(flying_thing):
    print(flying_thing.fly())

# 🧪 Testing polymorphism
bird = Bird()
airplane = Airplane()
let_it_fly(bird)      # Output: I soar in the sky! ☁️
let_it_fly(airplane)  # Output: I fly with engines! 🛫
```

### 🔹 **Operator Overloading Example** 🔹

```python
# ➕ Operator Overloading: Redefining the + operator
class Point:  # Class to represent a 2D point 📍
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):  # Overload + operator ➕
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    
    def __str__(self):  # String representation for printing 📝
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

# 🧪 Testing operator overloading
p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(3, 4)
p3 = p1 + p2  # Uses __add__ method
print(p3)  # Output: Point(4, 6)
```

**Linear Explanation**:  
Polymorphism lets different objects use the same method name in their own way. Duck typing means Python doesn’t care about the object’s type—just that it has the method (e.g., `fly`). Operator overloading lets you redefine operators like `+` to work with your custom objects, like adding two points together.

## 🕵️ **Abstraction** 🕵️

**What is it?**  
Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essentials. In Python, you use **abstract base classes** (from the `abc` module) to define methods that **must** be implemented by child classes. 🚪

### 📜 **Example Code** 📜

```python
# 🕵️ Using abc module for abstraction
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# 🕵️ Abstract base class
class Shape(ABC):  # Inherits from ABC 🖼️
    @abstractmethod  # Mark method as abstract
    def area(self):  # Child classes MUST implement this
        pass

# 🕵️ Concrete class implementing the abstract method
class Circle(Shape):  # Child class ⚪
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):  # Must override abstract method 📏
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

# 🕵️ Another concrete class
class Rectangle(Shape):  # Child class ▭
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):  # Must override abstract method 📏
        return self.width * self.height

# 🧪 Testing abstraction
circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
print(rectangle.area())  # Output: 24
```

**Linear Explanation**:  
Abstraction is like giving a blueprint: the abstract class says, “You must have an `area` method,” but doesn’t say how to calculate it. Child classes (like `Circle` or `Rectangle`) fill in the details. The `abc` module ensures child classes implement the required methods, or Python raises an error.
